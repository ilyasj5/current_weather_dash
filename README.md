# current_weather_dash
Using weatherstack's current weather API system, this application allows you to input and city in the world and in return, you will recieve current weather data about that city. Data such as temperature, weather description, and wind speed will be made visible. I also added suggestions based on the data on whether on not you should be outside at the given moment and whether or not you should take an umbrella or winter clothing outside.
